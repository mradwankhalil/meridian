/**
 * The provider-neutral upstream seam.
 *
 * Meridian's inbound surfaces — the Anthropic Messages API and the OpenAI
 * Responses API — describe the CLIENT. Which vendor actually serves a request
 * is a separate axis: a Codex CLI client may legitimately be served by Claude
 * today and by another provider tomorrow. `AgentAdapter` already owns the
 * first axis (session headers, working-directory parsing, tool mappings), so
 * overloading it with the second would collapse two independent questions
 * into one. This registry owns the second axis and nothing else.
 *
 * The boundary is ONE COMPLETE PROVIDER REQUEST: credentials, streaming,
 * failure classification and account rotation all live inside `handle`. A
 * seam any deeper would force a non-Claude backend to synthesize Agent SDK
 * events, session ids and resume semantics it does not have, and every
 * synthesized value would be somewhere a foreign request could leak into
 * Claude's machinery. The high seam costs some duplication and buys a wall.
 *
 * Provider-neutral by construction: no vendor name appears here beyond the
 * `ProviderId` union, and the module is generic over the HTTP context type so
 * it never imports Hono — server.ts remains the only module that touches HTTP
 * concerns (ARCHITECTURE.md, dependency rule 4).
